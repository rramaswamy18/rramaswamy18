Sri Siddhi Vinayaka Cultural Center, Inc was incorporated in California in May 2001<br />
<br />
Sri Siddhi Vinayaka Cultural Center Inc started operating the Sri Siddhi Vinayaka Temple in Sacramento, California beginning June 2001. After years of effort, we found the location from which we believe we could serve the greater Sacramento community.<br />
<br />
The organization also seeks to serve people all around the world. The areas that the organization seeks to specifically target are cultural education, contribution to worthy causes around the world without regard to geographical boundaries, social services, etc.<br />
<br />
The temple recognizes the importance of supporting community causes as well in order to make a difference in people’s lives in tangible terms. To that end, it supports students or families based on need, available resources and other factors. We also support the community relief efforts by giving to the Food drives from the local shelters and participating in blood drives by local organizations.<br />
<br />
The temple is open seven days a week and serves the community in the Sacramento and surrounding areas.<br />
<br />
Please support our efforts generously. We have made it easier for you. We now accept credit cards. Please ask about it at the temple.<br />
<br />
Regular services at the temple are being performed. We welcome volunteers who would like to volunteer their time and services to the temple. You can teach classes for kids and/or adults or volunteer elsewhere. Please let us know your interest and we will find a way to work together.<br />
